Reinforcement learning based recommender system


Recommender systems have become an integral part of modern life, easing decision-making processes by
providing tailored suggestions amidst a sea of choices. Whether it's selecting the best products to purchase, connecting with
like-minded individuals, or identifying relevant content in an overwhelming digital landscape, recommender systems play a
crucial role in enhancing user experiences and satisfaction. However, as the demand for personalized recommendations
grows, so too does the need for advanced techniques that can adapt to dynamic user preferences and optimize long-term
outcomes. Traditional approaches to recommendation, such as collaborative filtering and content-based methods, have laid
a solid foundation for the field. Yet, they often fall short in capturing intricate user-item interactions and fail to address the
evolving nature of user preferences.

The rise of reinforcement learning (RL) presents a promising avenue for addressing these limitations by shifting
the focus from immediate rewards to long-term performance optimization. In recent years, the convergence of RL with
traditional recommendation techniques has sparked significant interest among researchers and practitioners. This fusion
offers the potential to create more adaptive and responsive recommendation systems capable of navigating the complexities
of user behavior and content dynamics. By leveraging RL, recommender systems can move beyond static recommendation
strategies and incorporate real-time feedback to continuously refine their recommendations, thus improving user satisfaction
and engagement. Moreover, the explosive growth of online content and services has accentuated the need for personalized
recommendation systems that can keep pace with rapidly changing user preferences and content dynamics. As users interact
with diverse content across various domains, from news aggregation to e-commerce platforms, the demand for sophisticated
recommendation algorithms becomes increasingly evident.
